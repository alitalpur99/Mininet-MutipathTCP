Topology is 4switches (S1.S2.S3.S4) with 2hosts(h1.S1, S4.h4).
Channel impairments are in between switch S2-S3, BW=10Mbps, Onewaydelay=20ms i.e. RTT=40ms,  and Queue size of 50 or 100 packets.
Rules are pre-installed using OVS-OFCTL command for OpenVSwithces.

Queue experiments of FOUR Switch and TWO Hosts with pre-installed enteries on switches, allows to have most of the packets
captured at the receiver switch.

The graph results show the confirmity of OpenFlow Oneway delay with the Wireshark and Kernel estimated RTT values.

Note:

The RAW Kernel RTT values are multiplied by (0.000125 , i.e. [1/(8*1000)]) to achieve the required value of 40ms RTT actually 
inserted between the switches S2-S3.
