Topology:

4switches (s1.s2.s3.s) and 4hosts (h1-s1, s2-h2, s3-h4, s4-h4)
Two competing flows (second flow started at 5sec, and again at 15sec)
BW=10Mbps, RTT=40ms, Queue size=100 packets, 

The plots for Wireshark, OpenFlow and RTT show similar trends. All grow up during second flow insertion,
at time=5sec, and 15 sec. 
Also due to the second flow isertion, there is congestion and hence the packets are dropped at switch-2.

Note:

The RAW Kernel RTT values are multiplied by (0.000125 , i.e. [1/(8*1000)]) to achieve the required value of
40ms RTT actually inserted between the switches S2-S3.
